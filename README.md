## [Chapter 0](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_0)

Before we can begin creating our first circuits, we need to know how to use a breadboard.  This is a simple tool which will help us prototype circuits; this chapter will quickly go over how to use a breadboard.


## [Chapter 1](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_1)

In this chapter we are going to run through the very bare-bone basics of the Arduino sketch.  

- setup()
- loop()
- println()


## [Chapter 2](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_2)

- simple digital output
- blink an LED
- byte variable type


## [Chapter 3](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_3)

- analog output
- fading a LED
- int type


## [Chapter 4](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_4)

- PWD digital output
- fading a LED
