## [Chapter 2](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_2)

In this chapter we are going to run through the very bare-bone basics of the Arduino sketch.  

- simple digital output
- blink an LED
- byte variable type
- use a switch (e.g. R while B is blinking)
- use the potentiometer
