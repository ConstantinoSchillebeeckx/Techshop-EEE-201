## [Chapter 0](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_0)

Before we begin building our circuits, we need to know how to use a breadboard properly.  This introductory chapter will cover the basics of how a breadboards work and will get you familiar with using them.

## [Chapter 1](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_1)

Let's get started with Arduino!  In this chapter we are going to cover the most basic parts of getting a [sketch](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sketch) running; we'll be covering the following topics:
- `setup()`
- `loop()`
- `println()`
- using comments
- variable type `string`


## [Chapter 2](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_2)

Our Arduino examples haven't actually done much yet, let's change that!  In this chapter we will learn how to control the blinking of a small light emitting diode (LED); we'll be covering the following topics:
- blinking an LED with `digitalWrite()`
- variable type `byte`
- using a normally open (NO) switch 
- using a potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the LED


## [Chapter 3](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_3)

In this chapter we are going to run through the very bare-bone basics of the Arduino sketch.  

- analog output
- fading a LED
- int type


## [Chapter 4](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/Techshop-EEE-201/tree/master/chapter_4)

In this chapter we are going to run through the very bare-bone basics of the Arduino sketch.  

- PWD digital output
- fading a LED
